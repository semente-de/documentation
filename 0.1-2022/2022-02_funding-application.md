# Semente: Seeding community-oriented technology policy

> Project application - successful.

## Activity

This project will build on ongoing collaborations between Edward King (SML) and Instituto Neos, which aim to create digital literacy initiatives that support social inclusion in Brazil. As part of an ESRC IAA project (£15,500), King commissioned a report from Instituto Neos to carry out a series of interviews with the leaders of organisations and public entities leading digital inclusion initiatives in the country. These formed the basis of a report – ID21  – outlining what these organisations have learned from two decades of work in this area and articulating the challenges they face in a political climate that has seen the withdrawal of government support for public policies on culture, technology and social inclusion. 

The filmed interviews and report provided the foundations of a second phase of the project, which received seedcorn funding from the BDFI (£8000). The objective here was to compile a digital archive of open educational resources to be used in constructing new community digital inclusion initiatives and policies. The resulting website – fonte.wiki – is being developed in collaboration between Instituto Neos and several organisations including Instituto Procumum, Coletivo Digital, Casa de Cultura Tainã and Associação Thydewá.

This funding will support the development of this next phase of the project. The aim of ‘Semente’ is to put into action the ideas and data collected in fonte.wiki in order to facilitate the creation of new community-based technology projects, or to better structure existing ones. True to the metaphor (semente means “seed” in Portuguese), the project seeks both to preserve the legacy of organisations that have run community technology initiatives since the early 2000s and use their experience to seed new projects and plans for the future. The project consists of a series of activities in four phases:

**Digital workshops**

We will organise four public workshops aimed at nonprofits, policymakers and social entrepreneurs. The workshops will present ID21 and fonte.wiki to interested parties and be used to co-design the Toolkit (see below).

**Toolkit**

The Semente Toolkit will be a publication released with permissive licensing. Its main objective is to foster the creation of new community-based technology projects and to improve existing ones. Inspired by similar initiatives such as the DIY Toolkit and Inspirador, the Toolkit will be co-designed with practitioners and researchers through the digital workshops, contemplating simultaneously the rich history of critical initiatives in Brazil and abroad with new possibilities in the present day.

**Exhibition**

As well as an online publication, Semente will also be available as a physical Exhibition. A prototype of the Exhibition will be set up at Instituto Neos in July 2022. Inspired by examples such as The Glassroom Community Edition, the Semente exhibition will be released under permissive licenses in the shape of self-printable materials that can be replicated by any interested party.

**Meeting**

A meeting to launch the Toolkit and the Exhibition will happen at Instituto Neos in July 2022, following all the health and safety rules of the time.
