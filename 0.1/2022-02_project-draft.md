# Semente

//Seeding community-oriented technology policy.//

## 1. Technology, communities and social good

For decades, Brazilian projects have been exploring ways to promote the use of technologies for social good. Influenced by contexts as diverse as urban social movements, open source activism and social entrepreneurship, several initiatives have expanded the understanding of digital inclusion and digital culture.

Instituto Neos - a nonprofit based in Ubatuba, Brazil - has been working with the University of Bristol for over a year, exploring the main characteristics of community-based technology projects. Leaders of such projects were interviewed to compose a panorama of the field. The interviews formed the basis of a report - ID21 - articulating what the main issues are at the present day and recommendations for organisations and public entities active in the area.

Once identifying a delicate situation following the withdrawal of support for public policies on culture, technology and social inclusion, the ID21 report was used to shape a second cooperation. Its objective was to compose a digital archive of open educational resources to be used in constructing new projects and policies. To prevent repeating the loss of documentation that followed the disappearance of a series of digital inclusion programmes in Brazil, the project focused on the resilience of digital assets.

The project resulted directly in a collaborative website - fonte.wiki - offering a collection of digital assets published permanently on the internet, informed by people who have been engaged with the field for decades. Additionally, the cooperation ensued discussions about community archives with a network of practitioners and organizations in Brazil.

## 2. Semente - concrete plans

Semente is planned to activate the ideas and data collected in fonte.wiki in order and facilitate the creation of new community-based technology projects, or to better structure existing ones. True to the metaphor (semente means “seed” in Portuguese), Semente connects directly to earlier generations of community-based technology projects, preserving their essence and projecting for the future. The project consists of a series of activities:

- Digital workshops
- Toolkit
- Exhibition
- Meeting

### Digital workshops

Four public workshops aimed at nonprofits, policymakers and social entrepreneurs will be organised. At the same time that the workshops present ID21 and fonte.wiki to interested parties, they will also be used to co-design the Toolkit (see below).

### Toolkit

The Semente Toolkit will be a publication released with permissive licensing. Its main objective is to foster the creation of new community-based technology projects and to improve existing ones. Inspired by similar initiatives such as the DIY Toolkit and Inspirador, the Toolkit will be co-designed with practitioners and researchers through the digital workshops, contemplating simultaneously the rich history of critical initiatives in Brazil and abroad with new possibilities possible in the present day.

### Exhibition

As a manner to expand beyond the reach of an online publication, Semente will also be available as a physical Exhibition. A prototype of the Exhibition will be set up at Instituto Neos in July 2022. Inspired by examples such as The Glassroom Community Edition, the Semente exhibition will be released under permissive licenses in the shape of self-printable materials to allow it to be replicated by any interested party.

### Meeting

A meeting to launch the Toolkit and the Exhibition will happen at Instituto Neos in July 2022, following all the health and safety rules of the time.
