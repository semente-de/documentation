# About semente

_semente_ is a method created for people working together on community-based projects. It emerged as an alternative to rigid planning models that often don’t reflect how communities truly live, act, and grow together.

We use a vocabulary inspired by community gardening, permaculture and re-foresting — with elements familiar and rooted in human experience that helps us talk across different realities about care, time, effort, and transformation.

Instead of offering fixed steps, _semente_ supports our work as it is — right now. Whether we are starting out, reorganising, or deepening work that is already underway, it helps us reflect, adapt, and move forward together.

There’s no need for formal roles or titles to take part. Leadership can be shared, and everyone has something to offer.

Each cycle brings new **Seeds** — shaped by what we’ve learned, lived, and hoped for. We don’t return to the starting point — we move forward in a spiral: wiser, stronger, and ready to grow again. One cycle might strengthen an existing project or give rise to something completely new. When we revisit past ideas, we do so with fresh perspective, deeper understanding, and greater resilience.

## The Interloop Model: Cycles, Not a Line

Our **Interloop** Model supports community-led projects through three evolving vectors of action: **Sowing**, **Handling**, and **Regeneration**. Cutting across all of them is the **Composter**, acting as a repository for everything we wish to set aside, allow to mature, and return to when the time is right.

The Interloop proposes a continuous cycle — a reminder that projects don’t follow a straight path, but evolve, grow, and transform with time.
