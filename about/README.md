# About semente

*semente* (Portuguese for "seed") is a **collaborative method** for **designing and visualizing collective projects and processes in a cyclical and regenerative way**. It arises from a **discomfort with the traditional format of projects**, which usually have a defined beginning, middle, and end, disconnected from the lives and experiences of the people involved.

Unlike traditional models, *semente* proposes a **flexible and adaptable approach**, which allows the project to be started from different points:

*   by the **idea / people** (the seed);
*   by the **questions** to be addressed;
*   by the **practices** to be developed;
*   by **previous experiences**.

The *semente* method inverts the linear logic of projects, **valuing the complete and spiral cycle**. The element of renewal at each turn of the spiral is the **seedbag** (a combination of ideas, dreams, intentions, desires, and people, communities, groups). The seedbag is the starting point of the cycle, where ideas, desires, and people come together.
