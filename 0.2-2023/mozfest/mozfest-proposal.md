# Semente - create community-based digital policy

> Proposal approved as an online activity during the 2023 edition of Mozilla Festival.

## Session Format

Workshop (60 minutes)

## Description

Semente is a participatory toolkit for co-designing community-based digital policy. It was created as a result of a series of collaboration projects between Brazilian activists and organisations and supported by the University of Bristol.

On a first scale, Semente is itself a community effort, having been developed through listening to recognised leaders in digital rights, media literacy, situated research and eco-social innovation. On a second layer, all the participants involved in the process were themselves community organisers, and that experience was embedded in the project.

The session at MozFest will be an exercise in using Semente to create new or improve existing community-based digital initiatives. Examples of initiatives are digital literacy strategies for nonprofits, territory-aware technology alliances, participatory policy-making on a local or regional level, or virtually any opportunity to shape technologies that promote ethical community values.

## Why are you bringing this session to MozFest?

Semente was created upon engaging with Brazilian practitioners for a couple of years about the state of digital literacy initiatives. We wanted a method to create situated digital projects that connect three realms: the interests and potentialities of particular communities; the background of open-source digital policy of the past; and more contemporary concerns about privacy, security, trust and environment. After a first round of testing, we feel it is the right time to improve on Semente's design and make it public.

## What are your session's engagement opportunities?

We hope Semente proves to be useful for participants to return to their own communities and create or improve digital projects there. Depending on interest, we may set up an ongoing environment for conversations and articulation post-mozfest.

## How will you scale your session to accomodate varying nmbers of participants?

The session will alternate between exposition moments in which the context and the toolkit are presented, and break-out groups to further the discussions and exercise the use of Semente. Depending on the demand, we can have more facilitators available to moderate the groups.
