## Videos

While developing v0.3, we recorded a series of videos.

### October 2024

- A first set of two videos (in Portuguese) about earlier phases of semente ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/2024-semente-02) / ([YouTube 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=835XcMYHLgg&list=PLSHdLCc8rAquu46BlqJEdqhrHafv-kIHU&index=3), [YouTube 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlBeTCCfTnc&list=PLSHdLCc8rAquu46BlqJEdqhrHafv-kIHU&index=4)).
- A video, also in Portuguese, starting to brainstorm on a potential alternative shape of the semente canvas ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/semente-cycles) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMt-VVZk9-o)).

### November 2024

- A more conceptual video (in Portuguese) on spirals ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/linhas-circulos-espirais) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FVgJoglx7g)). Some of the arguments here are also present in writings for [Future Beyond Repair](https://fbr.efeefe.me).
- A workshop in Portuguese with the semente team about the project's principles: communities, circularity, and regeneration. The video is available [here](https://archive.org/details/workshop-semente_11-24) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ5N1hMrrU4). The conversation was summarised in the blog post [Community Ways](https://semente.de/lab/community-ways).
- Short notes on the shape of semente canvas, in Portuguese ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/2024-11-25-semente-tabuleiro) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMjzSjBr4-o)).
- As experimentation went on, we also started making videos in English to document the experimentation with spiralled and cyclical shapes. While making the first one ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/semente_paper-prototyping) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exaneu79dYc)), the camera failed. So a second video was shot ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/semente-spiral-shaped-communities) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjYhaq-wibQ)). A slightly edited automated transcription is [here](spiral-shaped_video_transcription.txt). 

### December

- While preparing to use the evolving version of semente for a workshop with members of [GIG's](../gig) education group, Felipe felt the need to make another video - this one about the limitations of a straight-arrow-shaped perspective on projects ([archive.org](https://archive.org/details/semente-arrows-and-spirals) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jit6GcCBqQ)). The slides used for the video are available [here](spirals-arrows.pdf).
