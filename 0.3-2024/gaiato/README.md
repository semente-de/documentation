## About GAIATO

Translated from [their website](https://www.gaiato.org/):

> GAIATO was founded in 1992 as a non-governmental, non-profit organization focused on children, teenagers, and their families in situations of social risk. To achieve this goal, it develops projects that value local culture. At the time of its founding, Ubatuba was facing a significant number of children and adolescents living on the streets. In this context GAIATO was born, led by a group of volunteers headed by Mrs. Celeste, a businesswoman of Portuguese origin. They organized and founded the "Association of the Working Child" - now called GAIATO. Today, the organisation operates in the Ipiranguinha neighborhood, an area with the highest rates of social vulnerability in Ubatuba, on the northern coast of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
