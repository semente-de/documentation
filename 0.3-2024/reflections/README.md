## Videos

To start version 0.3, we recorded a series of videos. 

- In the first two videos, FF talked about earlier phases of semente. Available (in Portuguese) on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/2024-semente-02) and YouTube ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=835XcMYHLgg&list=PLSHdLCc8rAquu46BlqJEdqhrHafv-kIHU&index=3), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlBeTCCfTnc&list=PLSHdLCc8rAquu46BlqJEdqhrHafv-kIHU&index=4)).

- A third video, also in Portuguese, brainstorms on a potential alternative shape of the canvas. It can be seen on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/semente-cycles) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMt-VVZk9-o).

To better explain the image of spirals and its potentialities, FF made a more conceptual video. It's here on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/linhas-circulos-espirais) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FVgJoglx7g). Some of the arguments here are also present in writings for [Future Beyong Repair](https://fbr.efeefe.me).

Maira, Bernardo and Felipe had a workshop about the semente principles: communities, circularity and regeneration. The video is available [here](https://archive.org/details/workshop-semente_11-24) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ5N1hMrrU4). The conversation was summarised in the blog post [Community Ways](https://semente.de/lab/community-ways).

Felipe made another video to document the experimentation with spiralled and cyclical shapes, this one in English. The video is available from the [internet archive](https://archive.org/details/semente-spiral-shaped-communities) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjYhaq-wibQ), and a slightly edited automated transcription is [here](spiral-shaped_video_transcription.txt).
