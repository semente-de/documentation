## Videos

To start version 0.3, FF recorded a series of videos. 

The first two of them were about the earlier phases of semente. Available (in Portuguese) on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/2024-semente-02) and YouTube ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=835XcMYHLgg&list=PLSHdLCc8rAquu46BlqJEdqhrHafv-kIHU&index=3), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlBeTCCfTnc&list=PLSHdLCc8rAquu46BlqJEdqhrHafv-kIHU&index=4)).

A third video, also in Portuguese, documents insights about a potential alternative shape of the canvas. It can be seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMt-VVZk9-o).

To better explain the image of spirals and its potentialities, FF made another video, this one more conceptual. It's [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FVgJoglx7g).
