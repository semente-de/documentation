# semente residency - planning

//semente toolkit for community-based digital policies in Brazil.//

## Proposal description

Working with non-profit organisation GAIATO, this project will develop a new phase of semente, a participatory toolkit to create and maintain community-based digital policies and initiatives. Previous stages were funded by the BDFI, Participatory Research and Newton Funds.

Through workshops, design studies and a residency period in Brazil, the following objectives will be accomplished: 

- Improve the graphic design of the semente canvas;
- Co-create a set of conversation cards;
- Create documentation about how to use semente to work with different communities;
- Create a website in which to publish all the elements of semente (canvas, cards, and documentation) with free/open licences.

During the residency period, the team will work with staff members of GAIATO. Selected activities will extend an invitation to local partners experienced in community organisations in areas of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest such as Instituto Neos, Associação Cunhambebe, and others. The residency aims at testing the use of semente to create cooperation between organisations and develop local strategies for the critical appropriation of digital technologies (open and free) in the contexts of social inclusion and environmental protection.

## Background

Early stages of semente were based on a contextual understanding of how digital policies have been enacted and deployed in Brazil in different moments of recent history. It proposes that community values and social awareness are intrinsic to how information and communication technologies should be implemented and used in present times. By adopting a systems view that centres on creating strong relationships between interdependent stakeholders, semente can enable sustainable digital ecosystems.

The main objective of the next phase of development is to pilot the use of semente in the particular area of activity of GAIATO, a non-profit based in south-east Brazil, in Ubatuba. GAIATO has more than 40 years of history offering education and support for youngsters in Ipiranguinha, a working class neighbourhood of Ubatuba. Lately, they have developed media projects, supported leadership education among youngsters, and started a project about the right to play. Their knowledge of the community and territory is an asset to develop semente as a tool to visualise and improve local dynamics.


The project will also liaise with organisations and communities in Ubatuba, an area of high socio-ecological interest. It expects to further develop semente whilst demonstrating how it can be used to promote the critical appropriation of advanced digital technologies such as AI to drive social inclusion, environmental protection and new economic opportunities.
