# Semente residency - proposal

## Description

The project will develop a new phase of semente, a participatory toolkit to create and maintain community-based digital policies and initiatives. Previous stages were funded by the Newton Fund, BDFI and a Participatory Research Grant.

Through workshops, design studies and a residency period in Brazil, the following objectives will be accomplished:

- improve the graphic design of the semente canvas;
- co-create a set of conversation cards;
- create documentation about how to use semente to work with different communities;
- create a website in which to publish all the elements of semente (canvas, cards and documentation) with free/open licences.

The residency period will count on local partners active in community organisations in areas of Atlantic Rainforest. It will test the use of semente to create cooperation between organisations and develop local strategies for the critical appropriation of information and communication technologies in the contexts of social inclusion and environmental protection.

## Benefits

Early stages of semente were based on a contextual understanding of how digital policies have been enacted and deployed in Brazil in different moments of recent history. It proposes that community values and social awareness are intrinsic to how information and communication technologies should be implemented and used in present times. By adopting a systems view that centres on creating strong relationships between interdependent stakeholders, semente can enable sustainable digital ecosystems. The main objective of the next phase of development is to pilot the use of semente in the particular context of the Atlantic Rainforest in south-east Brazil. The project will partner with organisations and communities situated in such an area of high social-environmental interest. It expects to further develop semente whilst demonstrating how it can be used to promote the critical appropriation of advanced digital technologies such as AI to drive social inclusion, environmental protection and new economic opportunities.
