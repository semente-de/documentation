- Some interesting references on online communities:
	- [How to kickstart a community](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-kick-start-a-community/51295/2) (in the context of [discourse](https://discourse.org/), a software for online forums, but has useful tips overall). More about using discourse for online communities [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/building-a-discourse-community/) and [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/08/launching-a-successful-discourse-community/).
	- Feverbee talks about principles of online communities. I don't agree with much of their vocabulary and assumptions (for instance "[building addictive communities](https://vimeo.com/109945437)"), but like their idea of [Superusers](https://www.feverbee.com/superusercasestudy/).  And there may be relevant cases and advice [here](https://www.feverbee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/theprovenpath.pdf).

Another relatively old piece on ("web") communities that may still be valuable: [The 12 principles of collaboration](http://endofweb.pbworks.com/f/12principles.pdf). They are:

1. Purpose: We have a shared goal or interest.
2. Identity: We know who’s who.
3. Reputation: We recognize and build status based on our actions.
4. Governance: We agree that our behavior can be regulated according to shared or stated values.
5. Communication: We have ways to share information and ideas
6. Groups: We can relate to each other in smaller numbers.
7. Environment: We interact in a shared space that is appropriate to our goals.
8. Boundaries: We know who belongs and who doesn’t.
9. Trust: We know with whom we’re dealing and that it’s safe to do so.
10. Exchange: We can trade knowledge, support, goods, services, and ideas.
11. Expression: We have a group identity and know what other members are doing. We can easily indicate our preferences and opinions.
12. History: We can look back over our history and track our evolution.
