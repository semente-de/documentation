## Description

semente is a toolset for community initiatives designed with an anticolonial and collectivist perspective. It builds on contextual understanding of Brazilian collaborative digital policies, in different moments of recent history. semente was created by activist and researcher Felipe Schmidt Fonseca, and design researcher Bernardo van de Schepop, in partnership with Instituto Neos and the Tropixel network. Concrete founding elements for semente were:

- ID21 (2021), a study about grassroots digital initiatives in Brazil, based on 11 interviews with community leaders and activists.
- fonte.wiki (2021 -), an online repository of open educational resources about digital policy and community action.

semente was conceptualised through deep questioning about the resilience of community practice during the intense period of far-right dominance on federal politics in Brazil. It allows communities to identify and act on collective strenghts and weaknesses. The toolkit is informed by well-established non-western practices of tending to communities, generous leadership, and respect to time cycles. It proposes that community values and social awareness are intrinsic to how positive change should be sought in present times. By adopting a systems view that centres on creating strong relationships between interdependent stakeholders, semente can enable sustainable social ecologies.

## funding

semente was initially developed in collaboration with Instituto Neos in Brazil and funded with grants in partnership with the University of Bristol (Newton Fund, BDFI, and a Participatory Research Grant). The project was recently awarded a new grant via the University of Bristol (ISPF) to fund part of the residency in October 2024.
