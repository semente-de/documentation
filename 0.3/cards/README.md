## Prompt Cards – Full Deck

### SOWING

Ideas, Hunches, Questions, Roots, Intent, Listening, Potential, Timing, Conditions, Readiness  
Every project starts long before it starts.

Before the work begins, hunches, needs, values, and conditions shape what’s possible. This phase is about noticing what wants to grow and asking if the ground is ready. The SEEDs might be skills, insights, or questions and along this vector is the time of intent, care, and connection.

SW.0001 · INTENT

What is already present, before the idea, that this project could grow from?

Every project begins with something: a question, a need, a skill, or a quiet urgency. Look beyond the idea — what values, stories, or existing connections are already in the soil? That’s where the real seed lives.

**For 15 min**: Distribute paper and pencils. Ask each person to write a short reflection on what’s already present in or around them, making this project possible. Then, share in pairs.

**Who**: Anyone connected to the early stages of the work. Especially good for founding teams or new collaborators.

**Related**: SW.0003 • SW.0007 • HN.0001 • RG.0015

---

SW.0002 · VISION

What needs or desires gave rise to this idea?

Ideas don’t grow from nowhere. Explore the conditions, frustrations, or hopes that made this one sprout. Understanding them makes the direction clearer and more rooted.

**For 20 min**: In small groups, ask each person to describe the feeling or story that sparked the idea. Record keywords or emotions on a shared sheet.

**Who**: Project initiators, originators, or those who’ve inherited the idea.

**Related**: SW.0012 • SW.0010 • HN.0008 • RG.0010

---

SW.0003 · VISION

What are you already carrying that can help this idea grow?

Skills, relationships, lived experience, access — these are seeds too. Take inventory of what’s already in your hands before you look for more.

**For 15–20 min.**: Ask each person to write down 3–5 assets they bring to this work. Share in a circle or in pairs. Optional: Build a visible “SEED map” with post-its.

**Who**: Whole team or early working group. Helps surface strengths and unknown capacities.

**Related**: SW.0001 • SW.0007 • HN.0010 • CP.0015

SW.0004 · CO-CREATION

Who else should be here from the beginning?

The way you begin shapes what can grow. Who are the voices, communities, or perspectives that belong in the soil, not just in the harvest?

**For 15 min.**: Ask each person to quietly list 2–3 people or groups they think should be involved early. The,n share aloud and cluster common themes.

**Who**: Any project group starting something new. Especially useful to catch blind spots in representation.

SW.0005 · INTENT

Why now?

What makes this the right season to begin? What’s shifting — in you, the world, or the soil?

**For 15 min**: Invite people to journal or reflect in pairs on “why this, why now?” Prompt a second round: What would happen if you waited instead?

**Who**: Founders or early participants. Useful at moments of pause or restarts.

**Related**: SW.0012 • HN.0008 • RG.0015 • CP.0001

### HANDLING

Effort, Tending, Care, Support, Growth, Trust, Feedback, Focus, Collaboration, Adjustment

Once an idea is planted, it needs care.

The Handling phase is where things take shape through coordination, feedback, effort, and support. It’s about nurturing what’s growing, letting go of what doesn’t serve, and recognising the signs of early harvest. This is where the work becomes real.

![handling cards](cards-handling.png)

---

HN.0001 · CO-CREATION

What does this project need now to keep growing?

RG.0018 · VISION

What story do we want others to tell about this work?

Sometimes you don’t write your ending. What narrative would you want others to hold?

**For 20 min**: Write “the story we hope is told in small groups.” Share and shape a collective version.

**Who**: Full group, especially for public work.

**Related**: RG.0008 • HN.0017 • CP.0018 • SW.0011

---

RG.0019 · CO-CREATION

What relationships do we want to maintain?

Not all ties end with a project.

**For 15 min.:** Review your network. Who do you want to stay in touch with, and how?

**Who**: Group members with strong collaborative ties.

**Related**: RG.0013 • RG.0012 • HN.0014 • CP.0020

**Who**: Whole group or learning participants

**Related**: RG.0015 • HN.0005 • SW.0003 • CP.0015

---

RG.0021 · RITUALS

How do we take care of what’s been built?

Some things are fragile. Regeneration also means stewardship.

**For 20 min.:** Identify what needs ongoing care: a relationship, a platform, or a practice. Decide how to support it moving forward.

**Who**: Coordination team, community stewards, or whole group

### COMPOSTER

Release, Letting go, Unused, Residue, Missteps, Reframing, Humility, Patterns, Transformation, Rest

No project is perfect or unfolds in a straight line.

Even the missteps, side paths, and half-formed ideas may hold value. They might not serve you now, but they could spark insight for someone else later. Don’t discard them — compost them. Composting is about reflection, release, and transformation.

![composter cards](cards-composter.png)

---

CP.0001 · REFLECTION

What effort or failed attempt could still hold value later?

Let it rest. Some ideas just need different timing or context. What didn’t serve today might be treasured tomorrow. Compost it with care.

**For 15 min.:** Ask the group to name ideas, tasks, or efforts that haven’t gone anywhere yet. Record them in a “compost” list for future reuse.

**Who**: The whole group is at the project close or reflection point.

**Related**: RG.0011 • RG.0007 • SW.0007 • RG.0004

---

CP.0002 · REFLECTION

What are we letting go of — and why?

Not everything needs to be finished. Releasing something can be a sign of clarity, not failure.

**For 15 min**: Invite each person to write down one thing they’re ready to stop. Share the reasoning, if they wish.

**Who**: Any project group that reflects together.

**Related**: RG.0005 • CP.0005 • HN.0003 • RG.0009

---

CP.0003 · DECISIONS

What impact did we forget to measure?

Not all value fits into a spreadsheet. What signs of success went unrecorded — moments, emotions, shifts?

**For 20 min.:** Ask the group to share “invisible outcomes” and capture them in a shared document or visual.

**Who**: Learning, monitoring, or storytelling roles.

**Related**: HN.0009 • RG.0006 • RG.0010 • CP.0014

---

CP.0004 · CO-CREATION

What miscommunication keeps surfacing?

Sometimes it’s not the people — it’s the pattern. Composting can mean naming what didn’t quite click.

**For 20 min**: In small groups, reflect on any repeated misunderstandings. What might they reveal about assumptions or systems?

**Who**: Any working team, especially those continuing together.

**Related**: HN.0011 • CP.0012 • CP.0011 • HN.0001

---

CP.0005 · DECISIONS

What parts of the work are no longer needed?

Good composting is pruning. Let go of what’s taking energy without return, even if it once made sense.

**For 15 min**: As a group, list tasks or ideas that now feel unnecessary. Honour them — then release.

**Who**: Coordination teams or project managers.

**Related**: HN.0003 • RG.0011 • CP.0017 • HN.0021

---

CP.0006 · CONTEXT

Where did we repeat efforts that were already done elsewhere?

Sometimes we reinvent the wheel. Notice it — and compost the extra.

**For 20 min**: Identify duplicated work. Ask what systems or research might have prevented it.

**Who**: Delivery teams, researchers, or strategists.

**Related**: SW.0009 • HN.0018 • RG.0016 • CP.0019

---

CP.0007 · INTENT

What assumptions no longer serve us?

Projects carry invisible beliefs. Some stop helping. Let’s name and release them.

**For 15 min**: Ask the group to reflect: “What belief shaped this project that we now see differently?”

**Who**: All contributors, especially those designing what’s next.

**Related**: SW.0019 • CP.0015 • RG.0013 • SW.0005

---

CP.0008 · VISION

What didn’t make the final story — but still matters?

Some things don’t fit into the case study or report, but they shaped the process profoundly.

**For 20 min**: Ask: “What’s something true about this project we don’t usually discuss?” Share and honour.

**Who**: Project team or storytellers.

**Related**: RG.0018 • HN.0017 • CP.0018 • SW.0016

---

CP.0009 · REFLECTION

What feedback did we ignore or avoid?

Feedback isn’t always easy — or timely. What might be worth revisiting?

**For 15 min**: Ask: “Was there a piece of input we didn’t listen to that now feels more relevant?”

**Who**: Leads or whole team. Suitable for a post-project review.

**Related**: SW.0018 • HN.0010 • RG.0010 • CP.0011

---

CP.0010 · INTENT

Where did we drift from our values?

Drift happens. What moments made you pause — or should have?

**For 20 min.:** Revisit your values, mark where alignment frayed, and discuss how to prevent it next time.

**Who**: All team members, especially those holding culture or ethics.

**Related**: SW.0006 • HN.0006 • RG.0013 • SW.0019

---

CP.0011 · CO-CREATION

What tensions never got fully named?

Unspoken tensions can shape everything. Naming them can be a release.

**For 20 min**: Invite silent writing: “What was hard to talk about?” Share themes anonymously, then discuss openly.

**Who**: Whole group with high trust, or a trusted subgroup.

**Related**: CP.0004 • CP.0009 • HN.0014 • RG.0011

---

CP.0012 · CO-CREATION

What roles caused confusion or overlap?

Structure is part of compost, too. What roles, titles, or tasks blurred lines?

**For 15 min**: Review roles and tasks from the project. What caused repeated friction?

**Who**: Coordination group or process team.

**Related**: CP.0004 • HN.0011 • CP.0011 • SW.0007

---

CP.0013 · CO-CREATION

What did we neglect — and why?

Sometimes care slips. Acknowledge what was missed and why.

**For 20 min**: Ask: “What or who didn’t get the attention they needed?” Reflect on the impact.

**Who**: Any reflective team, especially during slowdowns or recovery.

**Related**: HN.0013 • SW.0015 • RG.0014 • CP.0020

---

CP.0014 · DECISIONS

What did we track that didn’t matter in the end?

Sometimes we measure what’s easy, not what counts.

**For 15 min**: Review indicators or goals. Which ones felt hollow in hindsight?

**Who**: Learning, impact, or strategy roles.

**Related**: CP.0003 • RG.0006 • HN.0009 • CP.0017

---

CP.0015 · INTENT

What did we chase that wasn’t truly ours?

Sometimes we follow someone else’s vision. Composting means letting go of what was never ours to begin with.

**For 20 min**: Reflect as a group: “When did we say yes just to stay afloat — or be seen?”

**Who**: Core team, funders, and partners.

**Related**: RG.0015 • SW.0012 • SW.0017 • RG.0017

---

CP.0016 · REFLECTION

What emotional residue are we carrying?

Even with success, some parts are complex. Composting includes feelings.

**For 15–20 min**: Ask: “What are you still holding?” Give space for honest, gentle sharing.

**Who**: Any team finishing something meaningful or intense.

**Related**: RG.0005 • RG.0011 • HN.0013 • CP.0021

---

CP.0017 · DECISIONS

What got deprioritised for the wrong reasons?

Some things were dropped too quickly — or for reasons that deserve review.

**For 15 min**: Make a list of dropped ideas. Which ones might still be worth revisiting later?

**Who**: Full team, especially at handover or evaluation.

**Related**: CP.0005 • CP.0014 • HN.0012 • RG.0004

---

CP.0018 · VISION

What parts of the story got too polished?

Sometimes we smooth out what was complex. Composting can mean telling it the truth.

**For 15 min**: Ask: “What part of the process was messier than we’ve said?”

**Who**: Communications, storytelling, or learning roles.

**Related**: CP.0008 • RG.0018 • HN.0017 • SW.0011

---

CP.0019 · CONTEXT

What did we try more than once, with the same result?

Repetition is data. If something kept failing, name it and reflect.

**For 20 min**: Map repeated approaches or messages. What kept falling flat — and why?

**Who**: Anyone involved in delivery or communications.

**Related**: CP.0006 • CP.0010 • CP.0001 • RG.0011

---

CP.0020 · CO-CREATION

What invitations were made but never answered?

Sometimes we reach out, and silence follows. What did we hope for, and what can we learn from the quiet?

**For 15 min**: Share invitations or partnerships that didn’t take off. Reflect on why.

**Who**: Engagement or partnership roles, or the full team.

**Related**: SW.0004 • HN.0014 • RG.0019 • CP.0013

---

CP.0021 · RITUALS

What deserves thanks, even if it didn’t work?

**WLD.OPENING**

**When the ground shifts, how do you move?**

These cards challenge your assumptions and test your project’s adaptability. Pull one when things feel too sure — or when you want to stress-test your path forward.

![wildcards](cards-wildcard.png)

---

**WLD.0001 · RESOURCES · ADAPTABILITY**

**What would you do if your primary source of support disappeared?**

Funding streams shift, political agendas change, and support can vanish overnight. If that happened halfway through, how would your group respond?

---

**WLD.0002 · OWNERSHIP · ADAPTABILITY**

**What if your community stops showing up?**

Communities change. People drift. What signs would you look for — and how would you reconnect?

---

**WLD.0003 · EVIDENCE · ALIGNMENT**

**What if your project had to prove its value tomorrow?**

Imagine you’re asked to show concrete, measurable results — now. Not everything is easy to measure. But what would you show, say, or share if someone asked you right now?

---

**WLD.0004 · DISRUPTION · ADAPTABILITY**

**What if external conditions changed your whole context?**

From politics to weather, things shift quickly. What would still matter if your world were turned upside down in your work?

---

**WLD.0005 · TEAMWORK · ADAPTABILITY**

**What if a key team member stepped away?**

Groups change shape. People move on. How would you keep going while honouring their role?

---

**WLD.0006 · RESOURCES · LIMITS**

**What if your resources were cut in half?**

Less time. Less money. Less energy. What could you stop, simplify, or let go of — while still keeping the heart of the work alive?

---

**WLD.0007 · OWNERSHIP · OVERLAP**

**What if someone else was already doing similar work nearby?**

Shared goals can bring connection or quiet competition. Would you collaborate, adjust your focus, or hold your ground?

---

**WLD.0008 · VISIBILITY · ADAPTABILITY**

**What if your project suddenly became a huge success — then what?**

Success brings pressure. Attention, growth, and big expectations can stretch a group. How would you protect what matters?

---

**WLD.0009 · RESOURCES · ALIGNMENT**

**What if a major investor wanted to scale your project — fast?**

A funder loves your idea. They want to take it big. But quick growth comes with risks. What would you protect, compromise, or walk away from?

---

**WLD.0010 · VISIBILITY · OWNERSHIP**

**What if your project caught national or international attention?**

When others start watching, stories get shaped. Who speaks for the work? How do you keep the narrative honest and share the credit?

---

**WLD.0011 · TEAMWORK · ADAPTABILITY**

**What if demand outpaced your ability to deliver?**

Everyone wants in — but you’re at capacity. What could you pause, simplify, or hand over to stay grounded?

---

**WLD.0012 · RESOURCES · ALIGNMENT**

**What if your new sponsor had a poor record on climate or justice?**

Money raises questions. Can you accept support without endorsing the source? Who decides what’s too far?

---

**WLD.0013 · TEAMWORK · ALIGNMENT**

**What if your group faced internal conflict around core values?**

Disagreements happen, even close teams disagree. What values are flexible — and what’s non-negotiable? How do you keep going without splitting?

---

**WLD.0014 · RESOURCES · TEAMWORK**

**What if growth or funding began to pull your team apart?**

Success can strain relationships. If new resources shift priorities, how do you stay in sync and protect the group’s trust?

---

**WLD.0015 · VISIBILITY · CONSTRAINS**

**What if you had to say no to opportunities just to stay sustainable?**

Sometimes, more is too much. What helps you say no, even to good things, and stick with it?

---

**WLD.0016 · ALIGNMENT · ADAPTABILITY**

**What if you needed to pause, but others wanted to push forward?**

Slowing down isn’t failure. But it can feel hard to justify. How would you stand by the need to rest?

---

**WLD.0017 · RESOURCES · EVIDENCE**

**What if funders or partners demanded numbers that miss the heart of your work?**

They want graphs. You know what really matters. How do you tell the whole narrative without losing what makes it real?

---

**WLD.0018 · OWNERSHIP · VISIBILITY**

**What if the media or funders spotlighted only a few people from your team?**

Attention isn’t always fair. How do you share credit, hold egos in check, and keep the group whole?

---

**WLD.0019 · DISRUPTION · OVERLAP**

**What if climate change forced you to completely rethink your project? **

What parts of your work could adapt if your setting changed overnight — floods, fires, politics?

---

**WLD.0020 · TEAMWORK · CONSTRAINTS**

**What if burnout quietly started spreading through the team?**

Not everyone says it out loud. What signs would you notice early, and what would you do before trust starts to fray?

---

**WLD.0021 · ALIGNMENT · VISIBILITY**

**What if your project became a model others wanted to copy?**

When your work inspires others, it feels good — and risky. Would you open it up, protect it, or set terms? Could copyleft strengthen your values or blur them?
