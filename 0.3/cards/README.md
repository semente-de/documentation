# Cards

The semente cards can be used to activate the [interloop](../interloop) and facilitate deep levels of collective conversation on community initiatives. The first set released in 2025 can be seen below.

## Card types

The cards are used to generate seven types of prompts:

1. Vision: Explore whatâ€™s possible and imagine long-term impact. _Ideation, narrative, research, long-term thinking, context mapping_.
1. Intent: Clarify why this matters, to whom, and why now. _Mission, personal drive, ethics, principles, and roots of the work_.
1. Context: Understand what surrounds, supports, or limits the work. _Ecosystem awareness, external shifts, redundancy, timing, risk_.
1. Decisions: Make choices, set priorities, and align direction. _Scoping, planning, metrics as decision inputs, and roadmapping_.
1. Reflection: Pause to learn, sense, and make meaning. _Retrospective, invisible outcomes, metrics as insight, storytelling_.
1. Co-creation: Shape the work together and share responsibility. _Community, roles, collaboration, partnership, trust_.
1. Rituals: Mark moments and care for group culture. _Closure, celebration, rhythm, emotional pace, and team dynamics_.

ðŸ’¡ Many prompt types, especially Vision, Intent, and Context, have a future-facing angle. Use these to imagine whatâ€™s next, rehearse possible futures, or explore the seeds of long-term change.

## Cards and the interloop

Each vector of the interloop has a subset of cards: _Sowing_, _Handling_, _Regeneration_. Additionally, there are also subsets for the _Composter_, and more open-ended _Wildcards_.
