# Visual Identity

semente's visual identity was updated in 2025 to become more versatile and flexible.

In February 2024, the semente team hosted a workshop presenting the initial phases of development of the toolkit and its visual identity - including the reference to the _Ing√°_ tree, used as a first measure for forest regeneration in areas of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. The workshop (in Portuguese) is available from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/semente-identidade-comunicacao) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISYXjBHd8gs).
