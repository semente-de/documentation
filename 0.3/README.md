# Semente 0.3

The third development iteration for semente is taking place through a series of activities:

- Ongoing [reflecting](reflecting) by the semente team on the toolkit, its shape, and its methods.
- Further development of the semente canvas, mechanics and cards. Sketches can be found [here](sketching).
- A residency in Ubatuba, Brazil with [GAIATO](gaiato) in February 2025.
- Discussion about potential pilot uses of semente.
- Exploration of opportunities for partnerships and public engagement. Documentation of submissions and proposals can be found [here](proposals).

## Goals

For semente 0.3, we're working to achieve the following:

- A streamlined version of the semente canvas.
- At least one set of cards.
- A guide and video on the cycle and mechanics of semente: how to use it.
- An accessible [website](https://semente.de) and comprehensive [documentation](https://github.com/semente-de/documentation) about the development of semente.

Additionally, the *semente LAB* is developing:

- an [open research blog](https://semente.de/lab) (in English), including ongoing reflections, references, sketches, experiments, and conversations. Additionally, experimenting with aspects of semente such as cycles, spiral shapes and regeneration, and conducting public conversations in the Tropixel network, documented openly.
- Open-ended experimentation with semente: streamlined versions of the toolkit, as exchange and pilots with different partners (for instance, with the [Karumb√©](karumbe) project and [Neos Institute](neos) in Ubatuba or the [global innovation gathering](gig)) and others to be defined).
- A playable version prototype / dynamic presentation of semente + documentation.
- Video tutorials and short presentations.

## Outputs
