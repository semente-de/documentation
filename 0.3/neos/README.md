# Instituto Neos

[Instituto Neos](https://coletivoneos.org/) is a nonprofit organisation in Ubatuba created with the purpose of _promoting the preservation and conservation of sociobiodiversity through transdisciplinary education. It works in three fronts: sustainable use of biodiversity, recovery of traditional cultures and dialogue with contemporary cultures, and self-knowledge and reconnection between humans and nature_.

Neos is a partner of semente since its [initial phases of development](../../0.1). During the development of 0.3, the association hosted a collaborative workshop aimed at using semente to facilitate collaboration between different organisations and communities.

This [blog post](https://semente.de/lab/neos-return/) documents the workshop.
