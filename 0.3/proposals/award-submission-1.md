//Submission for an award. Semente was not selected.//

## Background

Early stages of semente were based on a contextual understanding of how digital policies have been enacted and deployed in Brazil in different moments of recent history. It proposes that community values and social awareness are intrinsic to how information and communication technologies should be implemented and used in present times. By adopting a systems view that centres on creating strong relationships between interdependent stakeholders, semente can enable sustainable digital ecosystems. The main objective of the next phase of development is to pilot the use of semente in the particular context of the Atlantic Rainforest in south-east Brazil. The project will partner with organisations and communities situated in such an area of high social-environmental interest. It expects to further develop semente whilst demonstrating how it can be used to promote the critical appropriation of advanced digital technologies such as AI to drive social inclusion, environmental protection and new economic opportunities.

## Method

The project will develop a new phase of semente, a participatory toolkit to create and maintain community-based digital policies and initiatives. Previous stages were funded by the Newton Fund, BDFI and a Participatory Research Grant in the UK.

Through workshops, design studies and a residency period in Brazil, the following objectives will be accomplished:

- improve the graphic design of the semente canvas;
- co-create a set of conversation cards;
- create documentation about how to use semente to work with different communities;
- create a website in which to publish all the elements of semente (canvas, cards and documentation) with free/open licences.

The residency period will count on local partners active in community organisations in areas of Atlantic Rainforest. It will test the use of semente to create cooperation between organisations and develop local strategies for the critical appropriation of information and communication technologies in the contexts of social inclusion and environmental protection.


## Team

The project is led by Felipe Schmidt Fonseca, a long-time activist and researcher, and Bernardo Schepop, an experienced design researcher. Their partnership goes back over two decades. In 2002, they were co-founders of MetaReciclagem, a Brazilian network of community-based labs to refurbish donated computers and experiment with digital culture that influenced activist practices and government programmes. They reconnected recently to create semente, an attempt to distil what they learnt along years of experience developing participatory projects in very diverse institutional contexts. The project was developed as a cooperation between Instituto Neos, situated in the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, and the University of Bristol. It was presented in academic and nonprofit contexts, and now this new phase is being planned.

## Estimated reach

As Brazil seeks to recover from years of political crises, a series of progressive policies and programmes connecting communities, information technologies, culture and environment are being planned and deployed. The project leaders have a good relationship with key persons in charge of some of those projects, which will create opportunities to use semente as a participatory toolkit to visualise and improve such initiatives. The potential impact is sizeable. Felipe is also a member of the Global Innovation Gathering (GIG), a Berlin-based nonprofit leading a network of about 150 people in 40+ countries engaged with social innovation projects. Semente can be used by GIG in their projects and extended to its members. 

## Evidence

A recollection of the initial phases of developing semente was recently published as a chapter of the book "Driving Design II" edited by the Distributed Design platform:
