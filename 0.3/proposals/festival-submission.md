# semente - a toolkit to weave communities

> submission for a lightning talk at a festival in 2024. The proposal was rejected.

## Summary

semente is a toolkit to weave community-based projects. It is based on experiences in Brazil and abroad and is inspired by botanic and forestry. Instead of relying on single project leaders, semente advocates for a community-based approach with diversity, time and openness at its core.

## Description

The talk will describe semente, a toolkit to weave community-based projects. Building on decades of experience in diverse contexts in Brazil and abroad, semente (Portuguese for “seed”) is based on analogies coming from the fields of botanic, vegetable cultivation and forestry. Its main goal is to overcome common biases of participatory methods, such as a misplaced duality between focusing on things or individuals. Semente challenges the notion of a single project leader and instead advocates for a community-based approach, where diverse knowledge, aspirations, and levels of involvement are recognised and integrated. It highlights the importance of creating connections between multiple species and understanding the complex interdependencies within ecosystems. The metaphor of a seed symbolises diversity, multiplicity, memory, and rebirth, connecting past and present generations with the environmental conditions necessary for development.
